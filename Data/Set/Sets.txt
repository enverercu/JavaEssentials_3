Interface Set<E>
extends Collection<E>
A collection that contains no duplicate elements. 
More formally, sets contain no pair of elements e1 and e2 such that e1.equals(e2), and at most one null element.

Class HashSet<E>
This class implements the Set interface, backed by a hash table (actually a HashMap instance)
It makes no guarantees as to the iteration order of the set; in particular, 
it does not guarantee that the order will remain constant over time. 
This class permits the null element.
This class offers constant time performance for the basic operations (add, remove, contains and size), 
assuming the hash function disperses the elements properly among the buckets
Note that this implementation is not synchronized
Set s = Collections.synchronizedSet(new HashSet(...));
