FIFO : First in first out
Lineup : customers waiting serve from the starbucks in a line, first in first served
add (enqueue) : add an item to the end of the queue
remove (dequeue) : remove the item at the front of the queue
peek : get the item at the front of the queue
Abstract data type
Not dictate how you store the data
we wait other data structures to implement Queue 

implement with array : add remove operations time complexity constant O(1) time, resizing : O(n) linear time complexity
implement with linkedlist : add remove operations time complexity constant O(1) time, no need to resize
