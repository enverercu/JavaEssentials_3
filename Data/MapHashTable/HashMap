Features of Java Hashmap
a) The values can be stored in a map by forming a key-value pair. 
The value can be retrieved using the key by passing it to the correct method.

b) If no element exists in the Map, it will throw a ‘NoSuchElementException’.

c) HashMap stores only object references. 
That is why, it is impossible to use primitive data types like double or int. 
Use wrapper class (like Integer or Double) instead.
