What is the tradeoff between using an unordered array versus an ordered array?

The major advantage of an ordered array is that the search times have time complexity of O(log n), 
compared to that of an unordered array, which is O (n). 

The disadvantage of an ordered array is that the insertion operation has a time complexity of O(n), 
because the elements with higher values must be moved to make room for the new element. 
Instead, the insertion operation for an unordered array takes constant time of O(1).
