ArrayList Vs Vector:
1) Synchronization: ArrayList is non-synchronized which means multiple threads 
can work on ArrayList at the same time. For e.g. if one thread is performing an add operation 
on ArrayList, there can be an another thread performing remove operation on ArrayList 
at the same time in a multithreaded environment

while Vector is synchronized. This means if one thread is working on Vector, no other thread can get a hold of it.
Unlike ArrayList, only one thread can perform an operation on vector at a time.


3) Performance: ArrayList gives better performance as it is non-synchronized. 
Vector operations gives poor performance as they are thread-safe, 
the thread which works on Vector gets a lock on it which makes other thread wait till the lock is released.


Therefore Vector should be avoided. If there is a need of thread-safe operation 
make ArrayList synchronized as discussed in 
the next section of this post or use CopyOnWriteArrayList which is a thread-safe variant of ArrayList
